      Superconductors are very different to their normal counterpart. Regular conductors are able to carry a charge and allow the flow of electrons. Although superconductors do the same thing, the materials used
      have zero electrical resistance and require critical temperatures to work efficiently. (Kirvan, 2023) This makes them much more effective in the real world as they can be implemented into things like trains,
      MRI scanner etc.
      
      Today, we are still trying to delve deeper into superconducting technology and are yet to see any major advancements. However, superconductors are still very useful, but they just require an expensive
      cooling system to work.

      Superconductivity is a state at which there is zero electrical resistance when at a critical temperature. This was first brought to light by physicist Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes in 1911. (Schmidt, 1997) 
      Superconductivity allows for a constant flow of current, making them much more efficient than normal conductors. This because the electrons within the material are coupled together as ’Cooper pairs’,
      which means that they more stable than singular electrons, thus making them less susceptible to the vibrations of the atoms in the material. As a result, they are able to travel through the lattice atom
      structure of the material without any friction, meaning that there is no resistance. (Bristol, n.d.) In addition to this, superconductors have the ability to create their own magnetic field and impedes
      other magnetic fields. In turn, this allows the superconductor to levitate when around other magnets. However, the main limitation of superconductors is that the metallic materials require a very low
      temperature (approximately zero degrees Kelvin/Absolute Zero), making them hard to implement into our everyday lives. (Becher, 2023)

      <h4>Uses of Superconductors: </h4>
      Superconductors have many useful applications to the real world. A few examples of this are;
      -MRI Scanners: MRI scanners use a very strong magnetic field which aligns the protons inside a persons body with the magnetic field. (Bioengineering, n.d.). Superconductors are used in an electromagnet
       which allows large currents to flow, due to the minimal resistance. This is a much better alternative to the copper coiled electromagnet as superconducting electromagnets do not reach high temperatures
       and so no current/energy is lost. In order to keep the electromagnet at low critical temperatures, liquid helium is used. (Paris-Saclay, n.d.)
      -Particle Accelerators: Particle accelerators heavily rely on the use of superconducting magnets. The Large Hadron Collider is one of the largest users of superconductivity. This is because circular
       particle accelerators use a magnetic field in order to keep the particle in orbit. If scientists want to test higher speeds, then a stronger magnetic field is required. As superconductors have no
       resistance, they can use stronger currents and so can produce stronger magnetic fields. (CERN, 2017)
      -Transportation: Although very rare, there are some cases in which superconductors have been used to enhance transportation systems. One example of this are ‘Maglev trains’, which are able to float above
       the track. The Japanese Maglev trains use superconducting electromagnets to repel the train from the track, causing it to levitate, and there is a change in polarity in the track which pulls the fronts
       of the train and pushes the back of it. In addition to this, the floating aspect of these trains means that there is no friction, which allows these trains to reach tremendous speeds of up to 310 mph. 
       However, the Japanese have heavily invested into this projected, mainly on the cooling system for the superconducting electromagnets. Despite the increase in energy saved by these trains, the cost of
       mass producing Maglev trains would be unsustainable and are thus not used everywhere. (Bonsor, 2022)
      
      <h4>Room-Temperature Superconductors: </h4>
      Regular superconductors must be cooled at extreme temperatures for them to work with little to no resistance. There have been some developments of superconductors that can be cooled at -23 degrees Celsius,
      however this is still hard to maintain and requires expensive equipment. (Pedram, 2023)
      
      Room-temperature superconductors, on the other hand, would not require any cooling as they are efficient at room-temperature, making them much easier to work with and much cheaper. They only require a highly
      pressurized environment which can be provided by putting them in a strong metallic casing. By implementing room-temperature superconductors into things such as transport and particle accelerators, the
      challenges of regular superconductors would not be faced. (Pedram, 2023) For example, money would not have to be invested in cooling systems. This means that it will be less difficult to use superconductors
      for power transmission. As a result, we could transfer power much quicker whilst losing none due to there being zero resistance. (Schmidt, 2007)
      
      As of earlier this year, there were talks of a room temperature superconductor being produced in South Korea called ’LK-99’, which sparked mass interest in the scientific community. However, this turned out
      to be false as the material used was in fact not a superconductor, but instead a chemical compound that had been levitated. (Fuhrer, 2023)
      
      <h4>Future of Superconductors: </h4>
      If in the future we are able to produce a working room temperature superconductor, we would be able to increase the amount efficient energy used in our technology, both old and new. (Knapp, 2023) Not only
      would they reduce the cost of construction, but they would also get rid of the need for expensive cooling systems which also demand lots of power. Without the bulky cooling systems, we could be looking at
      towards a greener future. For example, fusion reactors could be compacted and be mass produced across the world. (Yazdani-Asrami, 2023) This would increase the amount of clean energy produced, thus reducing
      the impact of climate change.
