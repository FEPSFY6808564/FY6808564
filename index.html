      Superconductivity is a state at which there is zero electrical resistance when at a critical temperature. This was first brought to light by physicist Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes in 1911. (Schmidt, 1997) 
      Superconductivity allows for a constant flow of current, making them much more efficient than normal conductors. This because the electrons within the material are coupled together as ’Cooper pairs’,
      which means that they more stable than singular electrons, thus making them less susceptible to the vibrations of the atoms in the material. As a result, they are able to travel through the lattice atom
      structure of the material without any friction, meaning that there is no resistance. (Bristol, n.d.) In addition to this, superconductors have the ability to create their own magnetic field and impedes
      other magnetic fields. In turn, this allows the superconductor to levitate when around other magnets. However, the main limitation of superconductors is that the metallic materials require a very low
      temperature (approximately zero degrees Kelvin/Absolute Zero), making them hard to implement into our everyday lives. (Becher, 2023)

      Superconductors have many useful applications to the real world. A few examples of this are;
        -MRI Scanners: MRI scanners use a very strong magnetic field which aligns the protons inside a persons body with the magnetic field. (Bioengineering, n.d.). Superconductors are used in an electromagnet
         which allows large currents to flow, due to the minimal resistance. This is a much better alternative to the copper coiled electromagnet as superconducting electromagnets do not reach high temperatures
         and so no current/energy is lost. In order to keep the electromagnet at low critical temperatures, liquid helium is used. (Paris-Saclay, n.d.)
        -Particle Accelerators: Particle accelerators heavily rely on the use of superconducting magnets. The Large Hadron Collider is one of the largest users of superconductivity. This is because circular
         particle accelerators use a magnetic field in order to keep the particle in orbit. If scientists want to test higher speeds, then a stronger magnetic field is required. As superconductors have no
         resistance, they can use stronger currents and so can produce stronger magnetic fields. (CERN, 2017)
